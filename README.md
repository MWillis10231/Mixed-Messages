## About

This project is part of the CodeAcademy Full-Stack Engineer course, which was redesigned in November 2020.

Project start 11/11/2020.

## Brief

"For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking."

### Project Objectives:

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Prerequisites:

- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

## Plan

Basic plan is as follows:

1. Get source(s) of random message / text
2. Write code that picks / merges them.
3. Check it works (GIT BASH / VS)
4. Use Git to push it to Github

## Method

I created my own kind of horoscope based on nonsense astrology - "Mars is bright tonight", etc..
These are stored in a series of arrays, and the program chooses random options using Math.Random. They are easily expandable too.

### What it divines:

- The weather next month (and if there is a eclipse or blood moon)
- What age you will live to (and gives a response based on certain age ranges)
- Who you will meet in the next month
- What that person will do to you

### Example:

"Hello fortune-seeker. I am the venerable Oracle of Delphi and I will tell you your future.  
I have consulted the heavens and they have revealed their secrets to me.  
The position of Mars in the sky is ominous. The east wind and the waxing crescent moon have divined much. The weather next month will be wet.  
Mars is also in flux. Due to the element of earth, this suggests that you will live to be 89.  
You will have a long life!  
In addition, because Aquarius and Pisces are mutable, you will meet a bartender in the next few weeks.  
This person will sell something to you, so be vigilant of them!"
